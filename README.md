The aim of this project is to develop a system to classify municpal solid waste (MSW) into different categories, so that they can be treated accordingly. We have used Deep Learning Neural Network Models for image recognition. To achieve our aim we have employed Deep Learning Neural Networks based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Architecture such as EfficientNet-B0, which is a model trained on Image-Net dataset and contains 1000 classes of objects, can be used as a pre-trained model. Further we will be using transfer learning to fine tune our model according to waste classification and classify the waste into the intended classes finally. The modle classifies waste into one these 6 categories - paper, plastic, metal, glass, organic and trash.
